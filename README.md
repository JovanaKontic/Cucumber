# Cucumber – DEMO QA – ALERTS PAGE
Website : https://demoqa.com           
This is an automation test demo which is using cucumber and selenium.     
One of the benefits of using Selenium for test automation is to apply software development processes that improve test-driven development and enable domain-driven, 
object-oriented analysis. One such development process is a type of test-driven development (TDD) framework known as behavior-driven development (BDD). 
**BDD** is designed to test an application's behavior from the end user's standpoint, whereas TDD is focused on testing smaller pieces of functionality in isolation.             
**TDD** is a development practice while BDD is a team methodology. 
In TDD, the developers write the tests while in BDD the automated specifications are created by users or testers 
(with developers wiring them to the code under test.) For small, co-located, developer-centric teams, TDD and BDD are effectively the same.              
Cucumber is easy to learn framework for BDD as it's in a plain meaningful English text. 
**Behavior-Driven Development** (BDD) is revolutionizing the way people build software.
Cucumber works by reading our specifications from plain English text files called feature files. 
It scans them for test scenarios, and runs those scenarios against our product. 
It works with Gherkin because the Gherkin syntax structures plain text so that it can be read by the tool. 
Cucumber reads Gherkin tests and validates that the code performs as it should.                   
Gherkin is a plain-text language with a simple structure. 
It is designed to be easy to learn by non-programmers, yet structured enough to allow concise description of test scenarios and examples to illustrate business 
rules in most real-world domains.
